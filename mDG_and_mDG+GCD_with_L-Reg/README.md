#### The code is modified form the Official PyTorch implementation of GMDG: [Rethinking Multi-domain Generalization with A General Learning Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18853).
#### Please follow the code implementation of GMDG for dependencies, data preparation and environment.



# L-Reg under mDG
Please set mask range to 0 and then use the hyper-paramerters we listed in the appendix for the experiments.



# L-Reg under mDG+GCD
